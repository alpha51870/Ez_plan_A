in this lesson we take a look at transmission samples obviously this has everything to do with

he threw and refractive surfaces like glass and water
he threw and refractive surfaces like glass and water

the number of those rays can be controlled using transmission samples here
the number of those rays can be controlled using transmission samples here
as you increase your transmission samples you are increasing the number of generated rays at that point and at the same time increasing the quality of the indirect transmissions and reducing the amount of noise from the indirect refractive areas

here's the scene that we have the same set up from the previous lessons I have a new object in the scene which is disc

glass

and this is the material that I have applied to my glass

to create a glass shooter obviously after you have applied your Arnold standard surface shader

you can simply choose

glass

presets from these preset menu up here

as you do that you can

the transmission wait he said to one and this is what gives us this refractive transmission quality

let me just increase the alvar all roughness to

may sounds like point twelve

and index of refraction is

said to one point fifty two by default which is the foremost household glasses



also if you take a look at the glass object and go to its shape note

under the Arnold tab I have disabled this opaque option you should do that if you want a render or refractive surface correctly this way all knows that this is

be a see through object

also the samples for the three area lights in the scene are set

or

so we don't get any noise in our direct diffuse and are direct secular passes

so let's open up to you and are sittings and with default settings

this is the render we are gonna have



to make the process a bit quicker I show you there are others that I have

snapshots so up any top



so this is the owner that we are having nice and beautiful

now lets decrease the camera diffuse and circular samples to Juan

Isis isn't William samples to on his will and let's enable deep

I p are

as you can see we have a very noisy result

as soon as I zero's my transmission samples you can see our glass has no refractive quality anymore

we just see some specula flexion

let's increase transmission samples

to one

and stop the IP are here

if we were under with the settings the result would be like to surrender

as you can see the glass and the rest of the scene is very noisy

now let's me increase my transmission samples to for and



if you take a look at the render was the current settings you can see

we have

increase the quality of our class

and finally

but we still have obviously some other noise

and finally we can increase the camera samples

like

more diffuse and seculars

maybe something like

*识别错误

and if I were under

the scene the result would be like this image here

as you can see the image perfectly is perfectly clear

and because we have increase are camera samples as well

the number of transmission samples are much more compared to the previous render

because remember day in put out transmission samples

multiplied by the counter samples

*识别错误

so maybe we can decrease our transmission samples at it and still have and noise fear render

I'll let you discover that possibility on your own time when you finished watching this lesson

so that's about transmission samples in Arnold

we still have sss samples and volume samples discuss we covered them later on in this course when we discussed subsurface scattering and Wally metric effects

and from the next lesson we start discussing right depth see there
